    "### 2.4 Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/ex4-backpropagation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm. Recall that the intuition behind the backpropagation algorithm is as follows. Given a training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$, we will first run a “forward pass” to compute all the activations throughout the network, including the output value of the hypothesis $h_\\theta(x)$. Then, for each node $j$ in layer $l$, we would like to compute an “error term” $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ that measures how much that node was “responsible” for any errors in our output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an output node, we can directly measure the difference between the network’s activation and the true target value, and use that to define $\\delta_j^{(3)}$ (since layer 3 is the output layer). For the hidden units, you will compute $\\delta_j^{(l)}$ based on a weighted average of the error terms of the nodes in layer $(l+1)$. In detail, here is the backpropagation algorithm (also depicted in the figure above). You should implement steps 1 to 4 in a loop that processes one example at a time. Concretely, you should implement a for-loop `for t in range(m)` and place steps 1-4 below inside the for-loop, with the $t^{th}$ iteration performing the calculation on the $t^{th}$ training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$. Step 5 will divide the accumulated gradients by $m$ to obtain the gradients for the neural network cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the input layer’s values $(a^{(1)})$ to the $t^{th }$training example $x^{(t)}$. Perform a feedforward pass, computing the activations $(z^{(2)}, a^{(2)}, z^{(3)}, a^{(3)})$ for layers 2 and 3. Note that you need to add a `+1` term to ensure that the vectors of activations for layers $a^{(1)}$ and $a^{(2)}$ also include the bias unit. In `numpy`, if a 1 is a column matrix, adding one corresponds to `a_1 = np.concatenate([np.ones((m, 1)), a_1], axis=1)`.\n",
